# :tada:Party monster

This project is the idea of 3 students of the Faculty of Mathematics in Belgrade who are eager to facilitate the organization of parties for themselves and others.\
For that reason **Party Monster, the prototip of an online-shopping app in Dart**, was made.\
You can use it to buy everything you need to organize parties for children and adults, even fun games or decorations.
